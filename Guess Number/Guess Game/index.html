    <p>
      &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;To play, you need to enter a number between 1 and 20 in the box located below the button labeled
      "Check!". Then,
      press this button and, in the square that contains the question mark, you will see the secret number you need to
      guess (provided that the entered number was correct).
      <br>
      &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;If the entered number is greater than the secret number, you will receive the message "Too
      high!",
      and if it is
      lower, the message "Too low!" will appear. Each time you guess incorrectly and press the "Verify"
      button, your
      score will decrease. It is important to note that the highest score will be recorded.
      <br>
      &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;If you guess the secret number, the screen will turn green, and you will have the option to
      press
      the "Retry"
      button to start a new round.
